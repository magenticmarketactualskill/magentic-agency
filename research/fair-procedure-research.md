# Fair Procedure Research Notes

## Definition

Fair procedure is a common-law doctrine from the Supreme Court of California (dating back to the 1880s) that applies to **private actors** with overwhelming economic power in certain fields.

## Key Principles

1. **Applies to Private Actors**: Unlike due process (which applies to state/government actors), fair procedure applies to private entities such as:
   - Professional associations
   - Unions
   - Hospitals
   - Insurance companies
   - Other entities with significant economic power

2. **Core Requirements**: These private actors cannot:
   - Arbitrarily expel members or employees
   - Deny persons admission for no logical reason
   - Must provide rudimentary procedural due process (notice and hearing)

3. **Threshold for Application**: Fair procedure only applies where the private entity's conduct would **destroy the plaintiff's right to practice a lawful trade or profession**.

## Key Distinctions

- **Less than full due process**: Fair procedure requires "something slightly less than procedural due process"
- **Not more than due process**: Cannot require more rights than would be available under government procedural due process
- **Economic power focus**: Targets entities with overwhelming economic power in specific fields

## Damages and Enforcement

- Damages can be substantial (e.g., $1,131,000 for arbitrarily denying admission to preferred provider network)
- Only applies when the entity's action would destroy livelihood/professional practice

## Application to Digital Platforms

For Magentic Agency, Fair Procedure principles suggest:

1. **Transparent Admission/Expulsion**: Clear criteria for who can join as experts or users
2. **Notice and Hearing**: Before removing experts or users, provide notice and opportunity to respond
3. **Non-Arbitrary Decisions**: Decisions about access, ratings, and participation must be based on logical, stated criteria
4. **Economic Power Recognition**: As a platform controlling access to income (experts) and resources (users), Magentic has significant economic power
5. **Procedural Protections**: Establish clear processes for disputes, appeals, and grievances
