We embed fairness into our code and our contracts. Our platform is architected to be an impartial arbiter, ensuring that all automated and human decisions are transparent, auditable, and non-arbitrary. We believe that a just system is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and innovation.

### 2. Radical Transparency
We operate with uncompromising clarity. All rules of participation, evaluation criteria, and dispute resolution processes are public and consistently enforced. We provide clear notice before any adverse action and ensure every member understands the "why" behind our decisions.

### 3. The Right to be Heard
We recognize the economic significance of our platform in the lives of our members. We are committed to the common-law principle of fair procedure, guaranteeing every participant the right to a fair hearing before they are deprived of their ability to practice their profession on our platform.

### 4. Empowered Accountability
We hold ourselves and our community accountable. Our governance model includes robust mechanisms for appeals and grievances, ensuring that every participant has a voice and that power is balanced with responsibility. Trust is not given; it is earned through verifiable accountability.
